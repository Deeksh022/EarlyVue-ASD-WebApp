# User-Specific Screening Data Implementation

## Overview
Implemented user-specific screening data storage so that each user (e.g., Deekshith, Sanath) only sees their own screening results when logged in with different credentials.

## Problem
Previously, all screening results were stored in a single localStorage key (`screeningResults`), which meant:
- All users saw the same screening data regardless of who was logged in
- Deekshith's screenings would appear for Sanath and vice versa
- No data isolation between different user accounts

## Solution
Modified the application to store screening results per user using user-specific localStorage keys.

## Changes Made

### 1. NewScreening.js (`src/pages/NewScreening.js`)
**Changes:**
- Modified screening result storage to use user-specific localStorage key: `screeningResults_${user.id}`
- Added `userId` field to each screening result object
- Results are now saved to `localStorage` with a key unique to each user

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: localStorage.getItem('screeningResults')
// After: localStorage.getItem(`screeningResults_${user.id}`)

// Added userId to result object
{
  id: Date.now(),
  userId: user.id,  // NEW: User ID added
  childId: screeningResult.patient_id,
  childName: screeningResult.patient_name,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. AllResults.js (`src/pages/AllResults.js`)
**Changes:**
- Modified to load screening results from user-specific localStorage key
- Added filtering to ensure only the current user's results are displayed
- Updated `addScreeningResult` function to include `userId`
- Updated `handleDeleteResult` to use user-specific storage key
- Added user dependency to `useEffect` hooks

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Load user-specific screening results
const storageKey = `screeningResults_${user.id}`;
const saved = localStorage.getItem(storageKey);
if (saved) {
  const results = JSON.parse(saved);
  // Filter to ensure we only show this user's results
  const userResults = results.filter(r => r.userId === user.id);
  setAllResults(userResults);
}
```

### 3. Dashboard.js (`src/pages/Dashboard.js`)
**Changes:**
- Modified to load screening history from user-specific localStorage key
- Added filtering to ensure only the current user's screening history is displayed
- Shows only the most recent 4 screenings for the logged-in user

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Load recent screenings from user-specific localStorage
const storageKey = `screeningResults_${user.id}`;
const savedResults = localStorage.getItem(storageKey);
if (savedResults) {
  const results = JSON.parse(savedResults);
  // Filter to ensure we only show this user's results
  const userResults = results.filter(r => r.userId === user.id);
  const formattedScreenings = userResults.slice(-4).reverse().map(result => ({
    // ... format result
  }));
  setScreeningHistory(formattedScreenings);
}
```

## How It Works

### Data Storage Structure
Each user's screening results are stored in localStorage with a unique key:
- **User 1 (Deekshith)**: `screeningResults_user-123456`
- **User 2 (Sanath)**: `screeningResults_user-789012`

### Data Isolation
1. When a user logs in, their `user.id` is available from the authentication context
2. All screening operations (save, load, delete) use `screeningResults_${user.id}` as the storage key
3. Each screening result includes a `userId` field for additional validation
4. When loading results, the app filters by `userId` to ensure data integrity

### User Flow
1. **Deekshith logs in** → `user.id = "user-123456"`
2. **Completes a screening** → Saved to `screeningResults_user-123456`
3. **Views Dashboard/Results** → Loads only from `screeningResults_user-123456`
4. **Deekshith logs out**

5. **Sanath logs in** → `user.id = "user-789012"`
6. **Completes a screening** → Saved to `screeningResults_user-789012`
7. **Views Dashboard/Results** → Loads only from `screeningResults_user-789012`
8. **Sanath sees ONLY his own screenings** ✓

## Benefits
✅ **Data Privacy**: Each user only sees their own screening data
✅ **Data Integrity**: User ID validation prevents cross-user data leakage
✅ **Clean Separation**: Different users have completely isolated screening histories
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing code structure maintained, only storage keys changed

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Create two test users** (e.g., Deekshith and Sanath)
2. **Log in as User 1** and complete a screening
3. **Verify** the screening appears in Dashboard and All Results
4. **Log out** and **log in as User 2**
5. **Verify** User 2 sees NO screenings from User 1
6. **Complete a screening as User 2**
7. **Verify** User 2 only sees their own screening
8. **Switch back to User 1** and verify User 1 still sees only their original screening

## Migration Notes
- **Old data**: If there's existing data in the old `screeningResults` key, it won't automatically migrate
- **Clean slate**: Each user starts with an empty screening history until they complete their first screening
- **No data loss**: Old data remains in localStorage but won't be displayed (can be manually migrated if needed)

## Future Enhancements
- Consider moving from localStorage to Supabase database for persistent, server-side storage
- Add data migration utility to move old localStorage data to user-specific keys
- Implement data sync across devices when using Supabase backend
- Add export/import functionality for screening data backup
