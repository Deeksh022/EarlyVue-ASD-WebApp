# View Details Button and Screen Removal

## Overview
Removed the "View Details" button and its associated ScreeningDetail page from the webapp as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. AllResults.js (`src/pages/AllResults.js`)
**Removed:**
- "View Details" button from the result card actions
- Navigation to `/screening/${result.id}` route

**Before:**
```javascript
<button
  className="medical-btn medical-btn-secondary"
  onClick={() => navigate(`/screening/${result.id}`)}
>
  üëÅÔ∏è View Details
</button>
```

**After:**
- Button completely removed
- Only "Download PDF" and "Delete" buttons remain

### 2. App.js (`src/App.js`)
**Removed:**
- Import statement: `import ScreeningDetail from './pages/ScreeningDetail';`
- Route definition for `/screening/:id`

**Before:**
```javascript
<Route path="/screening/:id" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <ScreeningDetail />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

**After:**
- Route completely removed from the application

### 3. ScreeningDetail.js (`src/pages/ScreeningDetail.js`)
**Action:**
- File deleted entirely (262 lines removed)
- This page is no longer accessible in the application

## Impact

### User Experience
- Users can no longer click "View Details" to see a detailed breakdown of individual screening results
- All screening information is now only available in the main results list view
- PDF reports remain downloadable for detailed information

### Navigation
- The route `/screening/:id` no longer exists
- Attempting to navigate to this route will result in a 404 or redirect

### Remaining Functionality
‚úÖ **Still Available:**
- View all screening results in list format (`/all-results`)
- Download PDF reports for detailed information
- Delete screening results
- Filter results by child
- View screening statistics and summaries

‚ùå **No Longer Available:**
- Detailed individual screening view page
- "View Details" button in results list

## Files Modified
1. `src/pages/AllResults.js` - Removed "View Details" button (lines 439-444)
2. `src/App.js` - Removed ScreeningDetail import and route (lines 15, 79-83)
3. `src/pages/ScreeningDetail.js` - **DELETED** (entire file removed)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Navigate to `/all-results` page
2. Verify that only "Download PDF" and "Delete" buttons appear
3. Confirm that clicking these buttons works correctly
4. Verify that attempting to navigate to `/screening/123` shows appropriate error or redirects
