# Account Summary Dynamic Update Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Account Summary section in MyProfile to dynamically reflect user-specific screening data that updates in real-time as screenings are added or deleted.

## Problem
The Account Summary in the MyProfile page was:
- Reading from the old global `screeningResults` localStorage key
- Showing screening counts from all users, not just the logged-in user
- Not updating dynamically when screenings were added or deleted
- Not consistent with the user-specific screening implementation

## Solution
Modified the MyProfile component to:
1. Load user-specific screening count on component mount
2. Store the count in component state for dynamic updates
3. Update the count when children/screenings are deleted
4. Use the same user-specific storage key pattern as other components

## Changes Made

### MyProfile.js (`src/pages/MyProfile.js`)

#### 1. Added State for Total Screenings
```javascript
const [totalScreenings, setTotalScreenings] = useState(0);
```

#### 2. Load User-Specific Screening Count on Mount
**Added to `useEffect` (lines 49-59):**
```javascript
// Load user-specific screening count
const storageKey = `screeningResults_${user.id}`;
const savedResults = localStorage.getItem(storageKey);
if (savedResults) {
  const results = JSON.parse(savedResults);
  // Filter to ensure we only count this user's results
  const userResults = results.filter(r => r.userId === user.id);
  setTotalScreenings(userResults.length);
} else {
  setTotalScreenings(0);
}
```

#### 3. Updated Account Summary Display
**Changed from:**
```javascript
<div className="medical-stat-value">
  {localStorage.getItem('screeningResults') ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('screeningResults')).length : 0}
</div>
```

**To:**
```javascript
<div className="medical-stat-value">
  {totalScreenings}
</div>
```

#### 4. Updated Delete Child Function
**Modified to use user-specific storage (lines 120-130):**
```javascript
const handleDeleteChild = async (childId, childName) => {
  if (!user) return;
  
  // Count how many screening results will be deleted from user-specific storage
  const storageKey = `screeningResults_${user.id}`;
  const saved = localStorage.getItem(storageKey);
  let screeningCount = 0;
  if (saved) {
    const results = JSON.parse(saved);
    screeningCount = results.filter(r => r.childId === childId.toString() || r.childId === childId).length;
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

#### 5. Update Screening Count After Deletion
**Added after deleting screenings (line 177):**
```javascript
// Update the total screenings count
setTotalScreenings(afterCount);
```

## How It Works

### Initial Load
1. User logs in and navigates to MyProfile
2. Component loads user-specific screening data from `screeningResults_${user.id}`
3. Filters results to ensure only current user's screenings are counted
4. Sets `totalScreenings` state with the count
5. Displays count in Account Summary

### Dynamic Updates
1. **When a child is deleted:**
   - Function filters out all screenings for that child
   - Saves updated results to user-specific localStorage
   - Updates `totalScreenings` state with new count
   - UI automatically reflects the new count

2. **When a new screening is completed:**
   - NewScreening.js saves to user-specific localStorage
   - User navigates to MyProfile
   - Component reloads and fetches updated count
   - Account Summary shows new total

### Data Consistency
- Uses same storage key pattern: `screeningResults_${user.id}`
- Filters by `userId` for additional validation
- Consistent with Dashboard and AllResults implementations
- No cross-user data contamination

## Benefits
✅ **User-Specific**: Each user sees only their own screening count
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Count updates immediately when screenings are deleted
✅ **Data Integrity**: Double-checks userId to prevent counting wrong data
✅ **Consistent**: Uses same storage pattern across all components
✅ **Accurate**: Reflects actual number of screenings for the logged-in user

## Account Summary Stats

The Account Summary now shows three key metrics:

1. **Total Children** - Number of registered children for this user
2. **Total Screenings** - Number of completed screenings (user-specific) ✨ UPDATED
3. **Member Since** - Account creation date

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenario 1: Initial Load
1. Log in as User 1 (Deekshith)
2. Navigate to MyProfile
3. Verify "Total Screenings" shows correct count for Deekshith only

### Test Scenario 2: After Adding Screening
1. Complete a new screening
2. Navigate to MyProfile
3. Verify "Total Screenings" count increased by 1

### Test Scenario 3: After Deleting Child
1. Delete a child that has screenings
2. Verify "Total Screenings" count decreases appropriately
3. Verify count matches the number shown in All Results page

### Test Scenario 4: User Isolation
1. Log in as User 1, complete 3 screenings
2. Log out, log in as User 2
3. Navigate to MyProfile
4. Verify "Total Screenings" shows 0 (not User 1's count)
